    Loot For Everyone is an evolution of Loot that gives everyone on earth a token representing a loot.
    But owner of the original loot, fear not, you can always burn your (now less useful) token to get an equivalent in "Loot For Everyone".
    You get to keep the token Id and all its associated item!
